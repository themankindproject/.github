> Systems-level implementations and experiments.

We design and benchmark low-level components with performance as a primary constraint. The work focuses on translating systems research into practical, testable implementations.



## Mission

Modern software often abstracts away hardware characteristics. themankindproject examines performance through the lens of cache behavior, instruction-level parallelism, and memory subsystems.

## Scope

- Re-implementations of systems research papers  
- Microarchitectural measurement and analysis  
- SIMD-based compression and encoding pipelines  
- Memory layout and cache-aware data structures  
- Low-level foundational crates  

## Principles

- Measure before optimizing  
- Benchmark all meaningful changes  
- Document trade-offs clearly  
- Prioritize reproducibility across architectures (x86_64, aarch64)  



## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from individuals interested in performance engineering, systems design, and reproducible experimentation.
